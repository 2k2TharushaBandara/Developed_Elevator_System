# Elevator Controller

This Arduino project, developed by BN, implements an elevator control system using various sensors and actuators. The system is designed to operate autonomously, responding to user inputs and environmental conditions to safely transport passengers between floors.

## Features
- Control buttons for selecting floors (ground, 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Emergency button and LED indicator
- Voice recognition for floor selection
- Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
- Smoke sensor for fire detection
- Load cell for weight measurement
- OLED display for status and weight indication

## Components
- Arduino board
- HX711 load cell amplifier
- Adafruit SSD1306 OLED display
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Smoke sensor
- SIM900A GSM module for SMS alerts
- Motor driver for elevator motor control

## Usage
1. Connect the components according to the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
3. Power on the system and test the functionality.
4. Use the control buttons or voice commands to operate the elevator.
5. In case of emergency, press the emergency button to notify authorities via SMS.

## Notes
- Ensure proper calibration of the load cell for accurate weight measurement.
- Test the system thoroughly before deploying it in a real-world scenario.
- Follow safety precautions when working with electrical components.
